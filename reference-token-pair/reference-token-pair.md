Do you think this contract is sufficient to deliver on CIP-68?

Why or why not?

Want to collaborate on a project to implement:
https://docs.nmkr.io/nmkr-studio/token/metadata/cip-68


Who should be able to change the datum? (It doesn't have to be the token holder...)

Next Steps:
1. Implement minimum reference-token-pair.ak
2. Implement related minting
3. Build transactions
4. Create a front end gallery for viewing images (decoding datum with Mesh)

So the real question here is, does this example provide a helpful description of CIP-68, or does it suggest something new and different? It depends on perspective, so what's yours?
